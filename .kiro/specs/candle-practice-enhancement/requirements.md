# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing Candle practice project to provide comprehensive learning exercises for fundamental tensor operations, matrix manipulations, and neural network construction. The enhancement focuses on creating a robust, cross-platform learning environment that automatically detects and utilizes the best available compute backend (CUDA, Apple GPU, or CPU) for optimal performance across different hardware configurations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer learning Candle, I want the application to automatically detect and use the best available compute backend, so that I can run the same code efficiently on different hardware configurations without manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL detect available compute backends in order of preference: CUDA, Apple Metal, CPU
2. WHEN CUDA is available THEN the system SHALL initialize and use CUDA backend for computations
3. WHEN CUDA is not available AND Apple Metal is available THEN the system SHALL initialize and use Metal backend for computations
4. WHEN neither CUDA nor Metal is available THEN the system SHALL fall back to CPU backend
5. WHEN backend initialization fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to the next available backend
6. WHEN a backend is selected THEN the system SHALL display which backend is being used

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer practicing tensor operations, I want comprehensive matrix operation examples, so that I can understand and practice fundamental linear algebra operations with Candle.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running matrix operation examples THEN the system SHALL demonstrate basic matrix creation with different data types (f32, f64, i32, u32)
2. WHEN running matrix operation examples THEN the system SHALL demonstrate matrix arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, element-wise operations)
3. WHEN running matrix operation examples THEN the system SHALL demonstrate matrix transformations (transpose, reshape, broadcasting)
4. WHEN running matrix operation examples THEN the system SHALL demonstrate advanced operations (matrix multiplication, dot product, cross product)
5. WHEN running matrix operation examples THEN the system SHALL demonstrate indexing and slicing operations
6. WHEN running matrix operation examples THEN the system SHALL display operation results and execution time for performance comparison

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer learning neural networks, I want neural network building examples, so that I can understand how to construct and train basic neural networks using Candle.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running neural network examples THEN the system SHALL demonstrate linear layer implementation and usage
2. WHEN running neural network examples THEN the system SHALL demonstrate activation function implementations (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh)
3. WHEN running neural network examples THEN the system SHALL demonstrate loss function implementations (MSE, Cross-entropy)
4. WHEN running neural network examples THEN the system SHALL demonstrate a simple feedforward network construction
5. WHEN running neural network examples THEN the system SHALL demonstrate basic training loop with forward and backward passes
6. WHEN running neural network examples THEN the system SHALL demonstrate gradient computation and parameter updates

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer using the practice application, I want organized and interactive examples, so that I can easily navigate through different learning topics and run specific exercises.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL present a menu of available practice categories
2. WHEN a user selects a category THEN the system SHALL display available exercises within that category
3. WHEN a user selects an exercise THEN the system SHALL execute the exercise and display results clearly
4. WHEN an exercise completes THEN the system SHALL provide options to run another exercise or return to the menu
5. WHEN running exercises THEN the system SHALL provide clear explanations of what each operation demonstrates
6. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display helpful error messages and continue operation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer comparing performance, I want timing and performance metrics, so that I can understand the performance characteristics of different operations across different backends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running any operation THEN the system SHALL measure and display execution time
2. WHEN running operations on different backends THEN the system SHALL allow comparison of performance metrics
3. WHEN running batch operations THEN the system SHALL display throughput metrics (operations per second)
4. WHEN memory-intensive operations are performed THEN the system SHALL display memory usage information where available
5. WHEN backend-specific optimizations are available THEN the system SHALL demonstrate their performance benefits
